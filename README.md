# MyTimer

A timer that works primarily for my own workflow:

1. A timer with 3 modes:
  a. Countdown timer with fixed duration (e.g. 25 min)
  b. Countdown timer with a random duration (user enters the desired mean and the sd)
  c. Regular timer with no pre-set duration
2. A tracker for:
  a. Total time lapsed per day: total, by each of the 3 modes above, by rough time of day (am/pm/eve)
  b. Time "earned" at a user-selected rate (e.g. 20% of total time lapsed/worked)
3. Display and feedback:
  a. Options to hide/show timer
  b. Options to hide/show total time lapsed and earned today
